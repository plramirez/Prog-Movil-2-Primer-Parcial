    <string name="bio">Pedro Luis Ram√≠rez (born December 26, 1997) is an American singer-songwriter.
        \n\nKnown for his autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Ramirez is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of widespread public interest.
        \n\nSwift signed with Big Machine Records in 2005, starting as a country pop singer with her first two albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008).
        \n\nTheir singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with Me" were crossover successes on country and pop radio formats.
        \n\nShe experimented with rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later recalibrating her image from country to pop music with the synth-pop album 1989 (2014).
        \n\nThe ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017); the albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood", and "Look What You Made Me Do".</string>
